      "Kim derived helpful insights from our market and user research, which she strongly wove into user stories for ideation. She allowed her ideas to flow easily during brainstorming, defining them into an actionable concept and advocating for accessibility along the way. Kim is not only a creative ideator but also a reliable team player. She joyfully put forth great effort in everything she did, making sure that fellow teammates felt supported also. In times where I felt unsure of my design decisions, I knew that I could turn to her to help me zoom out and see the larger picture of the project. Kim's design skills in addition to her warm personality make her an ideal teammate.",

      "Not only is Kim fun to work with, but she really cares about both her peers and her audience. She's a talented collaborator who will pull her weight and more.\n Kim has this innate ability to come up with very creative ideas and quickly iterate on them to make sure they always fit the project’s goal. She intuitively understands the users needs, synthesizes a vast amount of info, and that made her contribution that much more valuable.\n Moreover, her focus on making her design inclusive and accessible to all potential users was very impressive to me. Also, she did a great job explaining why that matters to our stakeholders. She had an active role in our presentations, and her storytelling abilities were very helpful to the team.",
